# purescript-react-basic-mui

There is an ongoing afford to provide to you well tested, lightweight and up to date PureScript binding for the Material UI library. We are testing this new API across different projects and it seems to be usable and stable already.
What is even more important we don't have plans to make any significant changes to the main API before the next upcoming major release. If you want to give it a try please check codegen-read-dts branch.
Sorry for this inconvenience.

As you may know MUI is a huge library with active community and maintaining such a vast FFI manually would be really big challenge. Probably impossible for such a small team as ours.
We have decided to extend our codegen approach even further to solve this situtation.

We hope you are going to enjoy the final result.
